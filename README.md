## 01_Climate_Data 
# Daily climate data obtained in 2014 from climate stations (HOBO U30 Station GSM-TCP Model) localized in three sites at low- (1101 masl), mid- (1255 masl) and high-altitude (1303 masl) of Serra do Cipó, Espinhaço Mountain range, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Climate data = photosynthetic active radiation (PAR – W/m2), precipitation (rainfall - mm), temperature (ºC), and (D) relative humidity (%).
## 02_Data_Reproductive_Ecology
# Data related to reproductive phenology, pollination, and flower visitor interactions in three populations of Microlicia laniflora (D.Don) Baill. (Microlicieae, Melastomataceae) at Serra do Cipó, Espinhaço Mountain range, Southeastern Brazil. Study sites are located at different altitudes: low-altitude site at 1101 masl (43º34'56"W; 19º14'16"S); mid-altitude site, at 1255 masl (43º33'20"W; 19º17'34"S); and high-altitude site, at 1303 masl (43º35'31"W; 19º17'42"S).
